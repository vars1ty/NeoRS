    What is it?
</h3>
<p align="center">
    <b>LWNV</b> is a set of configurations made for NeoVim, aimed mostly at C# and Rust development.
</p>
<h3 align="center">
    Why not VSCode, CLion or Rider?
</h3>
<p align="center">
    <b>VSCode</b> is built on Electron, and even though there are forks like <b>VSCodium</b> which removes the telemetry from VSCode, it still consumes a fair bit of resources.
    <br>
    <b>Rider and CLion</b> are nice, fast and has great features. But they both suck under Wayland (Java cringe) and does nothing but piss you off. To top it off, your RAM-Usage goes to the moon (unlike certain crypto).

* Auto-Completion;
* Syntax Highlighting;
* Tabs;
* A theme that doesn't burn your eyes at night;
* Structured config *(a.k.a, the configuration isn't just a jumbled mess in one single file)*;
* Fast;
* Hierarchy (or *Tree-View*);
* ToggleTerm;
* Pre-Configured keybindings, made so that even the new NeoVim users should feel comfortable with it;
* Smooth Scrolling when in NORMAL mode;
* True-Zen for focusing;
* Telescope;
* And more when I find something valuable to add.
